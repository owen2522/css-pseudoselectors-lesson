/*#####CSS file Create a CSS file that uses the following:

A rule that changes the text color of a link you've already visited. Make it a color that is not the default purple.

A rule that adds a width and a background color to your div with the id.

A rule that changes one or more of those properties when you hover over the div.

A rule that makes your button big and round. (Try exploring what border-radius does.)

A rule that changes something about your button when your button is clicked.

A rule or rules that make those properties change smoothly rather than instantly.

Any other rules you like. Make your button stand out! Change the font, font size, border colors and border style, even add box-shadow and text-shadow.
